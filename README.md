# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., discontinue their telecom services) based on their usage patterns and demographic details.

## Problem Statement

Churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing for proactive retention strategies. We'll explore patterns in customer behavior to predict churn using classification models.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Rows: ~7,043 customers
- Features: Demographic info, service usage, contract details
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model building
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation

## Tasks

- [x] Load and explore data
- [ ] Preprocess features
- [ ] Train multiple ML models
- [ ] Evaluate and compare performance
- [ ] Interpret model results using SHAP
- [ ] Optional: Deploy as Streamlit dashboard

## Goals

- Understand key factors driving customer churn
- Build and evaluate machine learning classifiers
- Improve interpretability using SHAP/feature importance
- Provide actionable insights for business decisions
